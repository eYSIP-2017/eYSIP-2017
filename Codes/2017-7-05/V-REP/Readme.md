The V-REP folder Contains Code, Model and Scene for __Generic Shape Formation Algorithm__

This contains version 1 and version 2, where version 1 has no implementation of robot avoidance algorithm and no tie breaking algorithm. Whereas version 2 contains the has a crude implementation of both robot avoidance algorithm and tie breaking algorithm. 

Refrence for the algorithm used: https://github.com/eYSIP-2017/eYSIP-2017_DistributedRobotics/tree/master/Documents/Manuals/Generic_Shape_Algo.pdf

We used V-REP simulator (EDU licence) to see the working of our algorithms.
Platform worked on : Ubuntu 16.04 

You can see https://github.com/eYSIP-2017/eYSIP-2017_DistributedRobotics/tree/master/Documents/Manuals/Understanding_V_REP.pdf to learn how to use V-REP for beginners

__Structrue of the Repository__

It contains three folders
1) Code : This contains the Child scripts which has been used for the simulation
2) Model: The model that was used/built in the simulation
3) Scene: The scene contains all the components i.e. the code and the model. You can just use the scene and visualise what is happing.
