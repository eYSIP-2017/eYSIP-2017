The V-REP folder Contains Code, Model and Scene for __Circle Formation of Distributed Robots__

Refrence for the algorithm used: "Circle Formation by Asynchronous Fat Robots
with Limited Visibility"

Available at : https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d91c/fba8866da0ac3147664a58bd62471d2acbdf.pdf

We used V-REP simulator (EDU licence) to see the working of our algorithms.
Platform worked on : Ubuntu 16.04 

You can see https://github.com/eYSIP-2017/eYSIP-2017_DistributedRobotics/tree/master/Documents/Manuals/Understanding_V_REP.pdf to learn how to use V-REP for beginners

__Structure of the Repository__

It contains three folders
1) Code : This contains the Child scripts which has been used for the simulation
2) Model: The model that was used/built in the simulation
3) Scene: The scene contains all the components i.e. the code and the model. You can just use the scene and visualise what is happing.
