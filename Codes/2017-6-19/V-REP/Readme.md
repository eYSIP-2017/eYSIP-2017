The V-REP folder Contains Code, Model and Scene for P-Controller of our model

We used V-REP simulator (EDU licence) to see the working of our algorithms.
Platform worked on : Ubuntu 16.04 

You can see https://github.com/eYSIP-2017/eYSIP-2017_DistributedRobotics/tree/master/Documents/Manuals/Uderstanding-V_REP.pdf to learn how to use V-REP for beginners

__Structue of the Repository__

It contains three folders
1) Code : This contains the Child scripts which has been used for the simulation
2) Model: The model that was used/built in the simulation
3) Scene: The scene contains all the components i.e. the code and the model. You can just use the scene and visualise what is happing.
