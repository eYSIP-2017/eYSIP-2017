	\chapter{Introduction}
	Thanks for choosing the Mini bots mobile robot platform. Mini bots will give you good
	exposure to the world of swarm robotics and embedded systems. Thanks to its innovative architecture
	and adoption of the ‘Open Source Philosophy’ in its software and hardware design, you will be
	able to create and contribute to complex applications that run on this platform, helping you
	acquire expertise as you spend more time with them.\\
	\textbf{Safety precautions:}
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item Robot’s electronics is static sensitive. Use robot in static free environment.
	\item If robot’s battery low buzzer starts beeping, immediately charge the batteries.
	\item To prevent fire hazard, do not expose the equipment to rain or moisture.
	\item Refrain from dismantling the unit or any of its accessories once robot is assembled.
	\item Never allow NiMH battery to deep discharge.
	\item Mount all the components with correct polarity.
	\item Keep wheels away from long hair or fur.
	\item Keep the robot away from the wet areas. Contact with water will damage the robot.
	\item To avoid risks of fall, keep your robot in a stable position.
	\item Do not attach any connectors while robot is powered ON.
	\item Never leave the robot powered ON when it is not in use.
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Inappropriate Operation:}\\
Inappropriate operation can damage your robot. Inappropriate operation includes, but is not
limited to:
	\begin{enumerate}		
	\item Dropping the robot, running it off an edge, or otherwise operating it in an irresponsible
	manner.
	\item Interfacing new hardware without considering compatibility
	\item Overloading the robot above its payload capacity.
	\item Exposing the robot to wet environments.
	\item Continuing to run the robot after hair, yarn, string, or any other item has become
	entangled in the robot’s axles or wheels.
	\item All other forms of inappropriate operation.
	\item Using robot in areas prone to static electricity.
\end{enumerate}

	\chapter{Powering up Mini bots}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{Mini bots are powered by six AA sized NiMH rechargeable batteries. 2.1Ah battery gives about
			two hour battery operation. Battery is available as preassembled 6 cell pack or robot has AA
			sized 6 cell battery holder.}
		\item{Before connecting the battery pack or inserting batteries in the socket, make sure that 	battery connection jumper of the robot is not put. You need to charge the battery before first use. Use any AC adaptor / SMPS	which can give accurate 12V DC and 1Amp current.}
	\end{itemize}

	\begin{itemize}
	\item {Mini bots are powered by 6 NiMH rechargeable batteries of 0.8Ah and above capacity. When it is
	fully discharged voltage drops to about 7V. Battery pack should not be discharged below 6V (1V
	per cell) to extend the battery life. Mini bots have onboard smart battery detector which monitors
	battery status. Nickel Metal Hydride batteries must be recharged externally.\\
	Power management block on the Mini bots performs following functions.\\
	1. Battery low warning in case battery is below critical level\\
	2. Regulated supply for onboard payload.\\
	3. Battery charging when robot is powered off and external battery charger is
	connected.\\}
	\end{itemize}

	\chapter[Battery Maintenance]{Battery Maintenance}
	\underline{\textbf{\Large{Battery Maintenance}}}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item {Fully charged NiMH battery will get completely discharged with in a week of storage. Always
			charge the battery before use. If fully charged battery is kept in storage for about a month and
			afterwards even if it’s fully charged again, it can deliver only 1/3rd power of its rating. In such
			case to restore battery to its full potential again, perform at least 2-3 charge discharge cycles.\\
			To ensure long life, charge battery at least once a week and discharge it till robot starts giving
			battery low warning. Before storage, charge the battery again.\\
			Disconnect the battery connector if robot is to be stored for long duration of time.}
	\end{itemize}
	
	\chapter{Motion control}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item {Mini bots has two 60 RPM DC geared motors in differential drive configuration. Robot has top speed of about 66cm per second. Using this
		configuration, the robot can turn with zero turning radius by rotating one wheel in clockwise
		direction and other in counterclockwise direction.\\
		Motion control involves direction control and velocity control. Motors are controlled by L293D
		dual motor driver which can provide up to 600mA of current to each motor. To change the
		direction of the motor, appropriate logic levels (High/Low) are applied to L293D’s direction
		control pins. Velocity control is done using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM).\\
		LEDs are connected at the input and the output stage of the motor driver for quick interpretation
		of the motion commands.}

	\chapter{Position encoders}
	\begin{itemize}
	\item {Position encoders give position / velocity feedback to the robot. It is used in closed loop to
		control robot’s position and velocity. Position encoder consists of slotted disc which rotates
		between optical encoder (optical transmitter and receiver). When slotted disc moves in between
		the optical encoder we get square wave signal whose pulse count indicates position and time
		period / frequency indicates velocity.\\
		Optical encoder MOC7811 is used for position encoder on the robot. It consists of IR LED and
		the photo transistor mounted in front of each other separated by a slot in black opaque casing
		with small slot shaped window facing each other. When IR light falls on the photo transistor it
		gets in to saturation and gives logic 0 as the output. In absence of the IR light it gives logic 1 as
		output. A slotted encoder disc is mounted on the wheel is placed in between the slot. When
		encoder disc rotates it cuts IR illumination alternately because of which photo transistor gives
		square pulse train as output. Output from the position encoder is cleaned using Schmitt trigger
		based inverter (not gate) IC CD40106. CD40106 also drives left and right position encoder status
		LEDs.

\chapter{Infrared proximity and Directional light intensity sensors}
\begin{itemize}
	\item {
		Infrared proximity sensors are used to detect proximity of any obstacles in the short range. IR
		proximity sensors have about 10cm sensing range. Mini bots has 8 IR proximity sensors.\\
		In the absence of the obstacle there is no reflected light hence no leakage current will flow
		through the photo transistor and output voltage of the photodiode will be around 5V. As obstacle
		comes closer, more light gets reflected and falls on the photo diode and leakage current flowing
		through the photo diode starts to increase which causes voltage across the diode to fall.\\
		If IR LEDs are disabled using jumpers then same photo diodes works as directional light
		intensity sensors.
		IR sensors detect the light from the transmitters present on the neighbouring robots for determining direction and distance of robots.\\

	\begin{itemize}
	\item {
	To interface LCD with the microcontroller in default configuration requires 3 control signals and
	8 data lines. This is known as 8 bit interfacing mode which requires total 11 I/O lines. To reduce
	the number of I/Os required for LCD interfacing we can use 4 bit interfacing mode which
	requires 3 control signals with 4 data lines. In this mode higher nibble and lower nibble of
	commands/data set needs to be sent separately.LCD is interfaced in 4 bit
	mode. The three control lines are referred to as EN, RS, and RW.

	\hfill\\
	
	\begin{itemize}
	\item {
		The EN line is called "Enable". This control line is used to tell the
		LCD that microcontroller has sent data to it or microcontroller is ready to receive data from
		LCD. This is indicated by a high-to-low transition on this line. To send data to the LCD, program
		should make sure that this line is low (0) and then set the other two control lines as required and
		put data on the data bus. When this is done, make EN high (1) and wait for the minimum amount
		of time as specified by the LCD datasheet, and end by bringing it to low (0) again.\\
		The RS line is the "Register Select" line and it is connected to PC0. When RS is low (0), the data
		is treated as a command or special instruction by the LCD (such as clear screen, position cursor,
		etc.). When RS is high (1), the data being sent is treated as text data which should be displayed
		on the screen.\\
		The RW line is the "Read/Write" control line. When RW is low (0),
		the information on the data bus is being written to the LCD. When RW is high (1), the program
		is effectively querying (or reading from) the LCD.\\
		The data bus is bidirectional, 4 bit wide.
		The MSB bit of data bus is also used as a Busy flag. When the Busy flag is 1, the LCD is
		in internal operation mode, and the next instruction will not be accepted. When RS = 0 and R/W
		= 1, the Busy flag is output. The next instruction must be written after ensuring that the
		busy flag is 0.
